# Extract, Transform, and Load Movies Data

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to run publicly-available datasets on movies through an extract, transform, and load (ETL) data pipeline to clean the datasets and save them to a PostgreSQL database named "movie_data".

Note that the "ratings.csv" file referenced in the code was too large of a file to load onto GitHub. The "movies_metadata.csv" and "ratings.csv" files come from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/download). The "wikipedia_movies.json" file comes from [Wikipedia](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-online/module_8/wikipedia-movies.json).
